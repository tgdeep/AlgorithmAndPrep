🛠️ SwiftUI Debugging Checklist

SwiftUI bugs are rarely random — they usually come from state, identity, or lifecycle misunderstandings.
Use this checklist before assuming SwiftUI is broken.

✅ 1. Is body Being Recomputed Too Often?
🔍 Debug
var body: some View {
    print("🔄 body recomputed")
    return Text("Hello")
}

✔️ Expected

Prints multiple times

This is normal

❌ Red Flag

Heavy work inside body

✅ 2. Did My View Lose Its Identity?
🔍 Ask Yourself

Did I change .id()?

Did navigation path values change?

Did ForEach identity change?

❌ Common Bug
.id(UUID())

✔️ Fix

Use stable IDs

Tie identity to real data

✅ 3. Is @State Resetting Unexpectedly?
🔍 Check

Is the view being recreated?

Is identity stable?

Is state owned by the correct view?

✔️ Fix

Lift state up

Move logic into a ViewModel

✅ 4. Am I Using the Correct Property Wrapper?
Symptom	Likely Cause
API called repeatedly	@ObservedObject misuse
State resets	Missing @StateObject
UI not updating	Missing @Published
Massive redraws	Overused @EnvironmentObject
✅ 5. Is Async Work Tied to Lifecycle Correctly?
❌ Bug
.onAppear {
    loadData()
}

✔️ Fix
.task {
    await loadData()
}

🔍 Debug Tip

Navigate back early

See if work cancels

✅ 6. Did I Forget an EnvironmentObject Injection?
❌ Crash
No ObservableObject of type X found

✔️ Fix
.environmentObject(MyObject())


Injected once at the root.

✅ 7. Is ForEach Identity Stable?
❌ Bug
ForEach(items, id: \.self)

✔️ Fix
ForEach(items, id: \.id)

🔍 Debug Tip

Watch for full list redraws

Animations breaking

✅ 8. Is the Compiler Error a ViewBuilder Explosion?
❌ Error
Result builder cannot build expression

✔️ Fix

Extract subviews

Use Group

Reduce body size

✅ 9. Am I Overusing AnyView?
❌ Symptom

Slower UI

Lost type safety

Harder debugging

✔️ Fix

Use Group

Align return types

Extract views

✅ 10. Is Navigation Resetting State?
🔍 Debug

Pop and push the screen

Does state reset?

✔️ Explanation

NavigationStack recreates views

Identity comes from path values

✔️ Fix

Lift state

Use stable navigation data

✅ 11. Is the Bug Actually Layout-Related?
🔍 Check

Hard-coded frames

GeometryReader misuse

Nested stacks

✔️ Fix

Let layout flow

Remove fixed sizes

Simplify hierarchy

✅ 12. Use SwiftUI Debug Tools
🛠️ Tools

Xcode → Debug View Hierarchy

Instruments → SwiftUI

Console logs (init, body)

🔥 SwiftUI Debugging Golden Rule

If something resets, flickers, or re-runs,
check identity first — not state.

🧠 Interview Power Answer

If asked:

“How do you debug SwiftUI issues?”

Say:

“I start by checking view identity, state ownership, and body recomputation. Most SwiftUI bugs come from identity changes or incorrect property wrapper usage.”
