🚫 SwiftUI Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

SwiftUI is powerful, but many issues come from UIKit habits carried forward.
Avoiding these anti-patterns prevents state bugs, performance issues, and crashes.

1️⃣ Doing Work Inside body
❌ Anti-Pattern
var body: some View {
    fetchData()
    return Text("Hello")
}

💥 Why It’s Bad

body is recomputed frequently

Causes repeated API calls

Leads to performance issues

✅ Correct
.task {
    await fetchData()
}

2️⃣ Treating SwiftUI Views Like Objects
❌ Anti-Pattern
struct MyView: View {
    var counter = 0
}

💥 Why It’s Bad

Views are value types

State resets on redraw

✅ Correct
@State private var counter = 0

3️⃣ Creating ViewModels with @ObservedObject
❌ Anti-Pattern
@ObservedObject var viewModel = MyViewModel()

💥 Why It’s Bad

ViewModel recreated on every view redraw

API calls repeat

State lost

✅ Correct
@StateObject var viewModel = MyViewModel()

4️⃣ Using .id(UUID()) to “Fix” UI Issues
❌ Anti-Pattern
.someView()
.id(UUID())

💥 Why It’s Bad

Forces view recreation every render

Resets all @State

Breaks animations

✅ Correct

Use .id() only when you intentionally want a reset.

5️⃣ Overusing AnyView
❌ Anti-Pattern
var content: AnyView {
    if condition {
        return AnyView(Text("A"))
    } else {
        return AnyView(Image(systemName: "xmark"))
    }
}

💥 Why It’s Bad

Loses type safety

Slower diffing

Hides design issues

✅ Correct

Use Group

Extract subviews

Align return types

6️⃣ Large Monolithic body Implementations
❌ Anti-Pattern
var body: some View {
    VStack {
        // hundreds of lines
    }
}

💥 Why It’s Bad

Compiler errors (ViewBuilder explosion)

Poor diffing

Hard to maintain

✅ Correct
var body: some View {
    VStack {
        header
        content
        footer
    }
}

7️⃣ Expecting Navigation to Preserve State
❌ UIKit Assumption

“Pushing and popping keeps state”

💥 SwiftUI Reality

NavigationStack recreates views

State resets if identity changes

✅ Correct

Lift state up

Use stable path values

Store state in ViewModels

8️⃣ Forgetting to Inject EnvironmentObject
❌ Anti-Pattern
@EnvironmentObject var session: UserSession

💥 Crash
No ObservableObject of type UserSession found

✅ Correct
.environmentObject(UserSession())


Injected once at the root.

9️⃣ Assuming onAppear Runs Once
❌ Anti-Pattern
.onAppear {
    loadData()
}

💥 Why It’s Bad

Can run multiple times

No cancellation support

✅ Correct
.task {
    await loadData()
}

🔟 Hard-Coding Layout Sizes Everywhere
❌ Anti-Pattern
.frame(width: 200, height: 50)

💥 Why It’s Bad

Breaks dynamic type

Poor adaptability

Fails on different devices

✅ Correct

Let layout flow naturally

Use alignment & spacing

Use GeometryReader sparingly

🔥 Biggest SwiftUI Anti-Pattern (Summary)

Treating SwiftUI like UIKit with better syntax.

SwiftUI requires:

Thinking in state

Understanding identity

Embracing value semantics

Trusting the framework

🧠 Interview Power Answer

If asked:

“What are common SwiftUI mistakes?”

Say:

“Most issues come from misunderstanding view identity, misusing property wrappers, and doing work inside body.”

⭐ Golden Rule Checklist

❌ No logic in body

❌ No UUID() for identity

❌ No ObservedObject ownership

❌ No heavy modifiers everywhere

✅ Stable identity

✅ Owned ViewModels

✅ Small composable views
