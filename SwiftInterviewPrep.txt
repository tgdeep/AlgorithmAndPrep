🔹 1. SwiftUI Fundamentals (Must-Know)
❓ Is SwiftUI declarative or imperative?

SwiftUI is declarative

You describe what the UI should look like for a given state

SwiftUI decides how to update the UI

Key Insight:

State drives UI, not the other way around.

❓ What is body in SwiftUI?

body is a computed property

It can be recomputed many times

Recompute ≠ View recreation

📁 Demo:

ViewRecreationBodyRecomputeView.swift

🔹 2. View Identity & Lifecycle (Very Important)
❓ Why does @State reset sometimes?

@State is tied to view identity

Changing .id() creates a new view

New identity → fresh state

📁 Demo:

ViewIdentityAndIdView.swift

❓ Is SwiftUI View a class or struct?

SwiftUI Views are structs

They are value types

Cheap to recreate

Interview Tip:

SwiftUI recreates views freely but preserves state via identity.

🔹 3. Navigation & State Reset (Tricky Topic)
❓ Why does state reset when navigating back?

NavigationStack recreates views

Identity comes from path values

Popping removes view & its state

📁 Demo:

NavigationStackIdentityResetView.swift

🔹 4. Property Wrappers (High-Frequency Questions)
❓ Difference between @State, @StateObject, @ObservedObject
Wrapper	Purpose
@State	Local value-type state
@StateObject	Owns reference-type state
@ObservedObject	Observes externally owned state

📁 Demo:

StateObjectVsObservedObjectView.swift

❓ Why was @StateObject introduced?

@ObservedObject recreates ViewModel on redraw

@StateObject preserves ownership

Prevents repeated API calls

🔹 5. Async & Concurrency (Modern SwiftUI)
❓ .task {} vs .onAppear {}
.task	.onAppear
Lifecycle-aware	Lifecycle-agnostic
Auto-cancelled	Not cancelled
Structured concurrency	Manual handling

📁 Demo:

TaskVsOnAppearView.swift

🔹 6. some View & Type System (Advanced)
❓ What does some View mean?

It is an opaque return type

Compiler chooses one concrete type

All return paths must match

📁 Demo:

OpaqueReturnTypeSomeView.swift


Interview Gold Line:

some View does NOT mean “any view”.

🔹 7. @ViewBuilder & Compiler Errors
❓ Why do large SwiftUI views fail to compile?

@ViewBuilder expands into tuple types

There is a hard limit on tuple size

Too many views → compiler explosion

📁 Demo:

ViewBuilderExplosionView.swift

🔹 8. Environment vs EnvironmentObject (Architecture)
❓ @Environment vs @EnvironmentObject
@Environment	@EnvironmentObject
Value-based	Reference-based
System-provided	App-provided
Safe	Crashes if missing
Read-only intent	Shared mutable state

📁 Demo:

EnvironmentVsEnvironmentObjectView.swift

🔹 9. Child → Parent Communication (Advanced Layout)
❓ How does a child view talk to a parent?

Use PreferenceKey

No callbacks or bindings

Common in layout measurement

📁 Demo:

ChildToParentPreferenceKeyView.swift
